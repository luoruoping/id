## Chemical Limestone Graymont
There are three distinct types of limestone,defined by their magnesium carbonate (MgCO 3) concentrations.These types are Dolomitic (35 to 46% MgCO 3),Magnesian (5 to 35% MgCO 3) and High calcium (less than 5% MgCO 3).C:Documents and SettingsMMy DocumentsPrint Files46data.SPEC JOINT 46 Today hydrated lime is efficiently and economically produced without the need for excess water,and ASTM C207 Type S lime does not require aging in putty form.The Lime Cycle LIMESTONE,CaCO3 MgCO3,used in production of lime,is blasted from quarry walls.HEAT,added in a calciner,raises rock temperature to 10000C (18000F.

## Dolomite Guideline
'Dolomitic Limestone'.Dolomitic Limestone,as a natural rock,consists of the mineral dolomite (CaMg(CO 3) 2) mixed with calcite (calcium carbonate,CaCO 3) and magnesite (magne sium carbonate,MgCO 3).Portions of the rock may be richer or poorer in either of the latter minerals.Dolomite is a sedimentary rock type.The composition of limestone What is limestone.Dolomite was named after the Dolomite mountains in southern Europe.It is a carbonate mineral that often forms from calcite.Sometimes liquids rich in magnesium carbonate (MgCO 3) (an atom of magnesium,an atom of carbon and three atoms of oxygen) pass through a limestone.When this happens,the CaCO 3 of the calcite picks up the MgCO 3,so forming dolomite.
