## Feldspar sandatlas
Feldspar is the most abundant mineral group in the Earth's crust.There are more feldspars (60%) than all the other minerals combined in the outer (13 17) km of the crust 1.Feldspars occur in most igneous and metamorphic rocks.They are less common in sedimentary rocks as they tend to break down to clay minerals in the weathering environment.What Are Rock Forming Minerals? geologyThese clastic rocks are composed of mainly quartz,clay minerals,and a small amount of micas and feldspar minerals.The carbonate rocks consist primarily of calcite and dolomite.A small number of materials,composed of a small number of minerals,make up most of the sediment and sedimentary rocks that cover the continents and ocean basins.

## Feldspars in sedimentary rocks SpringerLink
Feldspars are the most abundant mineral group in the Earth's crust,mainly because they form at a wide range of temperature and pressure encountered in igneous,metamorphic and sedimentary environments.Feldspars in sedimentary rocks can be of detrital and diagenetic origins.Sandstones and ConglomeratesFeldspar.Although feldspars are the most common minerals in igneous and metamorphic rocks,feldspars are less stable than quartz at conditions near the Earth's surface.Thus feldspars make up only 10 15% of all sandstones.Feldspars in sandstones consist of the following: Plagioclase usually showing albite twinning.

## Sandstone Minerals Education Coalition
Sandstone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of quartz sand,but it can also contain significant amounts of feldspar,and sometimes silt and clay.Sandstone that contains more than 90% quartz is called quartzose sandstone.When the sandstone contains more than 25% feldspar,it is called arkose or arkosic sandstone.Clastic Sedimentary Rock ClassificationSedimentary rocks are classified on the basis of the texture (grain size) of the rock,and composition.The basic classification only concerned texture,using the Wentworth size scale.But any full rock name must specify both texture and composition.Thus,an arkose sandstone is a rock of sand sized particles,with a high percentage of those particles being feldspar.
