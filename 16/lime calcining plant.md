## Calcination Wikipedia
The process of calcination derives its name from the Latin calcinare (to burn lime) due to its most common application,the decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide,in order to create cement.The product of calcination is usually referred to in general as "calcine",regardless of the actual minerals undergoing thermal treatment.(PDF) Reuse of water treatment residuals from lime softeningDue to the minimum transportation requirements and the desirability of recycling waste material,lime sludge from water treatment plants is a candidate for use as fill material in road construction.
