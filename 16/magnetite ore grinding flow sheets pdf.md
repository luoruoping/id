## Minerals Processing Magnetite Flows in the Beneficiation.
BI0224 AppNote Magnetite Flows.pdf.Description: In the iron ore beneficiation process where magnetite is present in the ore,an accurate volumetric flow rate is necessary in order to determine the mass flow measurement to balance the grinding and separation circuits.CiDRA's SONARtracÂ® flow meter delivers stable,accurate flow readings as.Iron Ore Processing for the Blast Furnace steelthe ore is reduced to 3 4" or less,it moves out of the mill in a slurry solution.The mill discharge is screened at 1 4" on trommel screens attached to the mill.Ore smaller than 1 4" is pumped in slurry solution to the wet cobber magnetic separator,which begins the process of separating the iron from the non iron material.
