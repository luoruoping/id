## Crushing Plant Jaw Crusher
Jaw Crusher >> E Mail:joyal@crusherinc >> Http: joyalcrusher Work principle The motor drives the mobile jaw up and down through eccentric shaft.The angle between toggle plate and mobile jaw increases when mobile jaw plate moves up.So the mobile jaw plate closes up the fixed jaw plate.The stuff will be crushed in this process.Jaw Crushers AggretekAGGRETEK Jaw Crushers are configured for primary crushing of the hardest rock.Incoming material is crushed between the jaw crusher's fixed die plate and movable die plate through advancing and retreating motions of the jaw crusher pitman arm.The Jaw Crusher main shaft bearing includes a dust seal with oil bath lubrication.
