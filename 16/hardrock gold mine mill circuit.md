## Hard Rock Mining and more Mt Baker Mining and Metals
The jaw crusher has been a staple of the hardrock mining industry since its invention.It is used as a primary crusher for all types of ores.The jaw typically takes the larger run of mine product and produces a sized discharge for feed to a secondary crusher such as a cone crusher,ball mill,or hammer mill.Ore processing Waihi GoldFollowing grinding in the ball mill,the material is returned via the sump (8) to the secondary hydrocyclone (9) for resizing.The trash screen (10) removes wood from the old mine workings that may have found its way into the processing circuit.The slurry that remains after this process has a very fine particle size.
