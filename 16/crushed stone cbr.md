A.California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of the Roadway Subgrade Soil The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is the ratio of the resistance to penetration developed by a subgrade soil to that developed by a specimen of standard crushed stone base material.The resistance of the crushed stone under standardized conditions is well established.The objective ofKENTUCKY TRANSPORTATION CENTERspecimens.The compacted specimens were 6 inches in diameter and 12 inches in height Crushed limestone base materials included Dense Graded Aggregate (DGA),and Crushed Stone Base (CSB).Number 57s,crushed river gravel,recycled concrete,and asphalt drainage blanket samples were submitted for testing by engineers of

## California Bearing Ratio(CBR Test) of Subgrade Soil.
The California Bearing Ratio Test(CBR test) is a penetration test that can be performed in the laboratory or in situ.They can be considered as small scale bearing tests in which the ratio of penetration to the size of the loaded area is much greater than in bearing tests.FM 5 430 00 1 Chptr 5 Subgrades and Base CoursesThe base course is normally the highest quality structural material used in a flexible pavement structure,having CBR values near the CBR standard material (crushed limestone).
