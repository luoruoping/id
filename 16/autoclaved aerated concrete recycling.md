## Preparation and properties of porous aerated concrete
Porous concrete,especially Aerated Autoclaved Concrete (AAC) was first developed by a Swedish engineer between the years 1920 and 1932 [1].He was searching for a material with the properties of wood,but without the disadvantages of wood.Near the end of World War II,AAC became widely used.ast areas of cities andPossibilities of Aerated Concrete Recyclate and Fluid Fly.Waste aerated concrete grit is produced either directly in the aerated concrete plant or subsequently on the building site.The options for handling aerated concrete grit are two.Either it can be used as a construction material,e.g.in the form of light aggregate or as a raw material for the production of aerated concrete.The subject of this article is the verification of aerated concrete.
