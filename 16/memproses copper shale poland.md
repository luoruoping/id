## Oil shale reserves Wikipedia
Oil shale deposits range from small presently economically unrecoverable to large potentially recoverable resources.Defining oil shale reserves is difficult,as the chemical composition of different oil shales,as well as their kerogen content and extraction technologies,vary significantly.Aurania found red bed copper in Ecuador? Mining JournalAurania Resources believes it has found red bed copper at its Lost Cities Cutucu project in Ecuador,having reassessed its exploration model in light of new observations in the field.
