Limestone,a sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3),is the precursor in the manufacture of lime and precipitated calcium carbonate,and is an important raw material with a wide range of applications; its primary use is in the construction industry,where it is the principal source of crushed rock aggregate.It is also.Effects of limestone powder on CaCO3 precipitation in CO2.It implied that the crystalline degree of the precipitated calcium carbonate was promoted by the use of the limestone powder.It seemed that incorporating limestone powder cannot only promote the precipitation of more calcium carbonate,but also improve the thermodynamic stability of the formed CaCO 3.3.4.XRD analysis
