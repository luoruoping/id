## Morrell C model SAGMILLING.COM
The same underlying model is used for SAG and ball milling,with minor differences for the way the charge density is calculated and whether the mill is a grate discharge (most of the SAG mills) or overflow discharge (typically a ball mill).Within the classification,there are also two versions of the Morrell C model:Mill (grinding) WikipediaSAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.
