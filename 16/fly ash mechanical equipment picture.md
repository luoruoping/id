## Flyash Australia
At its various operating sites,Fly ash Australia selectively collects fly ash and subject to rigorous testing,further refines these collected materials to produce quality fly ash products meeting the needs of our customers.The picture below explains the process of producing fly ash at a power station.Fly Ash Materials Handled Flexicon CorporationIn the past fly ash was released into the atmosphere,but local and regional pollution control standards now require that it is captured prior to release,usually by either mechanical or electrostatic separators.The collected fly ash is stored in silos for later disposal or beneficial re uses.
