Mineral deposits subject to acquisition in this manner are generally referred to as "locatable minerals." Locatable minerals include both metallic minerals (gold,silver,lead,copper,zinc,nickel,etc.) and nonmetallic minerals (fluorspar,mica,certain limestones and gypsum,tantalum,heavy minerals in placer form,and gemstones).Calcium sulfate WikipediaCalcium sulfate (or calcium sulphate) is the inorganic compound with the formula CaSO 4 and related hydrates.In the form of γ anhydrite (the anhydrous form),it is used as a desiccant.One particular hydrate is better known as plaster of Paris,and another occurs naturally as the mineral gypsum.It has many uses in industry.All forms are white solids that are poorly soluble in water.
