## Classification of Ball Mill Ball News Forging grinding.
Ball mill ball can be divided into two types: forging steel balls and casting steel balls,according to the manufacturing operation.Compared to casting steel balls,forging steel balls has some priorities:1) smooth surface: forging process,no defects on the surface,no deformation,keeping circle and good effect of ore grinding all the way.2) tight internal structure: made by forged steel to.casting grinding ball for ball mills YouTubeMay 31,2018 · Join LinkedIn today for free.selection of ball mills advisorpublicationsGrinding in ball mills is an The grinding ball is widely used at all over the world for high carbon high alloy casting.

## Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control
In industrial applications,the inner surface of the mill is lined with mill liners protecting the steel body of the mill and incorporating mill lifters which help to raise the content of the mill to greater heights before it drops and cascades down [36].There are three types of grinding media that are commonly used in ball mills:Ball milling digitalfireBall mills can reduce particles to the nano sizes,the process is very important in creating powders used in hi tech industries.Ball mills are slow compared to other methods of grinding,it could takes hours,for example,to grind all the particles in a clay to minus 200 mesh.
