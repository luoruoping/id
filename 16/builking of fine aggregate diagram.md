The reason is that moisture causes film of water around sand particles which results in the increase of volume of sand.For a moisture content percentage of 5 to 8 there will be an increase in volume up to 20 to 40 percent depending upon sand.If the sand is more fine there will be more increase in volume.This is known as bulking of sand.Sieve Analysis of Aggregates Civil EngineeringSieve analysis helps to determine the particle size distribution of the coarse and fine aggregates.This is done by sieving the aggregates as per IS: 2386 (Part I) 1963.In this we use different sieves as standardized by the IS code and then pass aggregates through them and thus collect different sized particles left over different sieves.
