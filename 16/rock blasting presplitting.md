## Understanding the connection between blasting and highwall.
Explosives are employed throughout the mining industry for primary rock breakage.There are a number of controlled blasting techniques that can be implemented to improve highwall stability.These include line drilling,smooth wall blasting,trim blasting,buffer blasting,air decking,and presplitting.Revised Rock Embankments Provisions and New Blasting and.A new table for PreSplitting of Rock has been added to the summary tables.The Geotechnical Summary Tables have been attached to this revised.Currently,there are 2 rock blasting special provision templates,one with pre splitting and one without.Since pre splitting has been added to the SP02 R88A provision,the rock blasting special.
