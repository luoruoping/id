crushing phases whereas chip formations are characterized by the negative slope lines in each cycle.Dutta (1972) put forth a theory explaining rock breakage phenomenon as a momentarily release of strain energy including both crushing and chipping events.It has been then shown that the rock breakage phenomenon can be considered as a brittle.Laboratory Comparison of Mini discs with Point attack PicksLaboratory Comparison of Mini discs with Point attack Picks Bulent Tiryaki a.sharp pick to affect rock breakage is in a direction approximately parallel to the rock surface [2,3].Crushing of the rock requires a very large amount of energy to form rock chips with discs [2,4].Evans [5] reported that for the cutter geometries that are.

## Bond Impact Crushing Work Index Procedure and Table of.
Sizing a crusher can be done reliably calculated thanks to the Impact Crushing Work Index and the testwork research done by Fred Chester Bond and his 1952 paper.According to Bond's Third Theory of Comminution,the work energy input is proportional to the new crack tip length created during particle breakage and equivalent to the work represented by the product the feed.MASTER'S THESISnew processing plant,in addition to new crushers,have sufficient capacity to reach the production goals; the current obstacle in the process of production increase is a bottleneck in crushers caused by oversize boulders.Boulders require extra efforts for secondary blasting or hammer breakage and if entered the crushers,they cause downtimes.

## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().Impact Crusher Working Principle 911metallurgistStarting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).
