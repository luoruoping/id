Shortly thereafter,Wah Chang constructed an antimony smelter in Changsha to produce antimony metal using low grade antimony ore.This smelter became one of 24 roasting furnaces and 19 reverberatory furnaces that made up Wah Change's first plant.This plant is viewed as the start of large scale antimony production in China.MIT's accidental smelting discovery unlocks the potential.Nov 28,2016 · The traditional method of producing antimony metal is through heat smelting.However,researchers at MIT claim to have accidentally stumbled upon a new method of smelting using electrolysis rather than heat.Research was funded by the US Department of Energy,the Advanced Research Projects Energy (ARPA E),and French energy company Total SA.

## Extraction of Antimony Element Antimony,Sb,Metalloid
Antimony is extracted mainly from ores containing antimony trisulphide in the form of stibnite.Rich ores are first subjected to liquation,whereby the fusible sulphide is removed from the gangue and concentrated.The concentrate is then reduced to metal by smelting with wrought iron in pots,in reverberatory furnaces or sometimes in blast.How to Remove Arsenic,Antimony & Bismuth from CopperRemoval of arsenic,antimony and bismuth from copper may take place in the smelting operations by scorification,volatilization,or,under special treatment,by processes of concentration.Owing to the great variety of materials that are treated in economical metallurgy,it is rarely possible to obtain exact weights from any particular operation.

## Antimony Smelting Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The history of the antimony industry of China dates back to 1897 when the Tai Shing Co.was formed,under contract with the Hunan Bureau of Mines,for the smelting of the ore to crude; and in 1908 the Wah Chang Mining & Smelting Co.was formed for the smelting and refining of the ore.Antimony Peak hundredpeaksClaims were staked in 1873 and a concentrating plant and ore smelter were erected in San Emigdio Canyon,two miles north and 3000 feet below the deposits.Several tunnels ranging from 20 to 600 feet in length were dug and the antimony ore carried out by pack animals to furnaces now long gone in San Emigdio Canyon.

## Antimony Wikipedia
Antimony is a chemical element with the symbol Sb (from Latin: stibium) and atomic number 51.A lustrous gray metalloid,it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb 2 S 3).Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics,often known by the Arabic name,kohl.Antimony Smelting Process foraeuropeofhumanrightsCopper,Lead and Zinc Smelting and Refining.The major hazards are exposure to ore dusts during ore processing and smelting,metal fumes (including lead,arsenic and antimony) during smelting,sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide during most smelting operations,noise from grinding and crushing operations and from furnaces,and heat stress from the furnaces.
