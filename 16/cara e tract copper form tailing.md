of tailings,which generally have the tendency to form acidic pit water (acid mine drainage).In addition to the copper porphyry deposits,sediment bound poly met al deposits represent the world's second most important copper source.In addition to copper,they contain a number of key co products,espe cially silver,cobalt,lead,and zinc.Tailingsfo What are tailings? Their nature and productionTailings characteristics can vary greatly and are dependent on the ore mineralogy together with the physical and chemical processes used to extract the economic product.Ritcey (1989) reported that tailings of the same type may possess different mineralogy and therefore will have different physical and chemical characteristics.
