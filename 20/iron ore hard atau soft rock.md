How Does Iron Ore Form Nearly all of Earth's major iron ore deposits are in rocks that formed over 1.8 billion years ago.At that time Earth's oceans contained abundant dissolved iron and almost no dissolved oxygen.The iron ore deposits began forming when the first organisms capable of photosynthesis began releasing oxygen into the waters.Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineralWhat is Hematite? Hematite is one of the most abundant minerals on Earth's surface and in the shallow crust.It is an iron oxide with a chemical composition of Fe 2 O 3.It is a common rock forming mineral found in sedimentary,metamorphic,and igneous rocks at locations throughout the world.Hematite is the most important ore of iron.Although it was once mined at thousands of locations around.
