## Differences: Peugeot Pepper Grinders vs.Salt Mills
Mar 25,2010 · The Peugeot salt mill's grinding mechanism does not use a channeling grinding process.The mechanism in the salt mill is designed to crush dry salt to its desired consistency rather than truly grind the salt.One word of caution: You should never use salt in a pepper grinder or pepper in a salt mill.Gristmill WikipediaA gristmill (also: grist mill,corn mill,flour mill,feed mill or feedmill) grinds cereal grain into flour and middlings.The term can refer to both the grinding mechanism and the building that holds it.
