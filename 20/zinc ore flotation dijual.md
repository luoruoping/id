## Extraction of Zinc Application Of Zinc Refining Process
Zinc Mining.The most commonly available ore used in the extraction of Zinc is called Zinc Blende also known as Zinc Sulphide (ZnS).Historically extraction of zinc has been more difficult than extraction of other metals because at temperatures where metals such as iron typically begins to melt,zinc is a gas.Lead Zinc oresThe established lead zinc ore flotation processing scheme is to add zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) to the grind to control metal ion activation (sphalerite depression).Often metabisulphide or other sulphidation chemicals are added with the zinc sulphate for iron sulphide mineral depression.
