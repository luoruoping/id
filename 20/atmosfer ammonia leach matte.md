## US3741752A Acid leaching process for treating high grade.
Nickel and copper values are separately recovered from coppernickel sulphide matte by means of a multi stage acid leach process.The matte is treated in a first leaching stage in which the acid to acid reactive metals molar ratio and leaching time are controlled to selectively extract the bulk of the nickel values while the copper values remain in the leach residue.CiteSeerX — An Investigation into the Effect of.Copper (Cu) bearing matte from Impala Refinery (Pty) Ltd was used in the investigation.The experiments were conducted in a leaching cell submerged in a water bath,with ammonia concentrations (leaching solution) of 3.0M,temperature of 50˚C,60˚C and 70˚C,pH of 11 and for a time period of 130 minutes.

## Oxidative dissolution of nickel matte in dilute sulfuric.
Nickel matte (Ni 3 S 2) is the most common feedstock for producing nickel oxide and nickel metal in associated refineries.Nickel matte is produced from sulfide or laterite ores,and contains around 73 wt% nickel.This study investigated the dissolution parameters of nickel matte in dilute sulfuric acid media in the presence of air as oxidant with the goal of presenting a cost effective process.ABSTRACTNickel matte is a nickel &de concentrate produced by smelting.It consists mainly of two components: a nickel copper alloy and heazlewoodite (Ni3S2); but also contains varying amounts of djurleite,CU~.~~S.There are several hydrometallurgical routes for processing nickel matte.The most recent of these involves an oxidative leach in acid

and ammonia leaching has been based on local conditions or the composition of the matte.Acid leaching has been used for mattes with substantial cobalt contents (above 3%),while ammonia leaching has been widely used for Ni Cu mattes with low cobalt contents (Pearce et al.1960).However,with further developments in acid pressure leachingNickel processing Extraction and refining BritannicaVarious processes are used to treat nickel matte.One process is the ammonia pressure leach,in which nickel is recovered from solution using hydrogen reduction,and the sulfur is recovered as ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer.In another,the matte may be roasted to produce high grade nickel oxides; these are subjected to a pressure leach,and the solution is electro and carbonyl refined.
