## Soil pH Wikipedia
Soil pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of a soil.pH is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the activity of hydronium ions (H + or,more precisely,H 3 O + aq) in a solution.In soils,it is measured in a slurry of soil mixed with water (or a salt solution,such as 0.01 M CaCl 2),and normally falls between 3 and 10,with 7 being neutral.Material Safety Data SheetHazardous Decomposition Products: Limestone ignites on contact with fluorine and is incompatible with acids,alum,ammonium salts,and magnesium.Silica reacts violently with powerful oxidizing agents such a s fluorine,boron trifluoride,chlorine trifluoride,manganese trifluoride,and oxygen difluoride yielding poss ible fire and or explosions.
