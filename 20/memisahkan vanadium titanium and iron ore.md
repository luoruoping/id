## Vanadium Wikipedia
Vanadium steel allowed reduced weight while increasing tensile strength (ca.1905).For the first decade of the 20 th century,most vanadium ore was mined by American Vanadium Company from the Minas Ragra in Peru.Later the demand for uranium rose,leading to increased mining of that metal's ores.Vanadium: The metal we can't do without and don't produce.Oct 24,2017 · Vanadium is typically found within magnetite iron ore deposits,and is usually mined as a byproduct and not as a primary mineral.Vanadium is often agglomerated with titanium.

## Titanium resources,reserves and production Metalpedia
Titanium resources,reserves and production; Occurrence in nature; Titanium is present in the Earth's crust at a level of about 0.6% and is therefore the fourth most abundant structural metal after aluminum,iron and magnesium.Titanium is always bonded to other elements in nature.It is present in most igneous rocks and in sediments derived from them (as well as in living things and natural.Vanadium processing BritannicaOre deposits mined solely for vanadium are rare because much of the vanadium in igneous rocks occurs in the relatively insoluble trivalent state,substituting for ferric iron in ferromagnesium silicates,magnetite (an iron ore),ilmenite (a titanium ore),and chromite.
