## Early History Through 1875 TelosNet
The mill machinery was commonly enclosed in a building,which also featured a wall or shield to block the incoming wind from slowing the side of the drag type rotor that advanced toward the wind.Vertical axis windmills were also used in China,which is often claimed as their birthplace.Savonius Wind Turbines REUKSavonius wind turbines are best suited to applications such as pumping water (see image above) and grinding grain for which slow rotation and high torque are desireable.They are often used in the Third World in exactly these ways with wind turbines made from an old oil barrel (or barrels) welded to a pole which is passed through bearings taken from an old vehicle.
