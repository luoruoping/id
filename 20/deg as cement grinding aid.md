## Grinding aids for high performance cements C ADD Mapei
Grinding aids for high performance cements Grinding aids are organic compounds that are added to the mill during cement grinding.Their main purpose is to reduce the energy required to grind the clinker into a given fineness.In addition,some products (usually referred to as performance enhancers) provide positive effect on cement hydration.SINTEF Building and Infrastructure Christian J.EngelsenIn summary,conventional grinding aids are used to increase the production rate in the cement mill.If such additions give beneficial chemical effects during hydration of the final cement (e.g.increased strength,improved workability etc.) the grinding aid is regarded as.
