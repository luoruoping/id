## PRB Coal Properties boilercleaning
PRB Coal Properties.The Powder River Coal (PRB) is classified as sub bituminous ranked coal.Unlike higher ranked bituminous and anthracite coals,which have tight pore structures that limit the amount of inherent moisture they could hold,low rank coals like PRB coal have this looser pore structure and additional moisture retention capacity.Powder River Basin WikipediaThe Powder River Basin is the largest coal mining region in the United States,but most of the coal is buried too deeply to be economically accessible.The Powder River Basin coal beds are shaped like elongated bowls and as mines expand from east to west in the Powder River Basin,they will be going "down the sides of the bowl".
