## Cracks when grinding hard chromium plating: Problems.
Then when it cools,it tries to contract but cannot,and a tensile residual stress is the result.Since chrome is more brittle than most steels,it stands to reason that the chrome will crack long before the steel.In the aircraft industry,great effort is often made to achieve low stress grinding.Wafer Backgrinding Silicon Wafer Thinning Wafer BackgrindAll wafer backgrinding is performed in a class 10K cleanroom with critical thin wafer taping processes performed at a class 100 workstation.Ultra fine grind wheels to obtain low stress polish or mirror like finish;.Let us help you with your next back grinding wafer project.

## How to choose the grinding wheels for stainless steel.
Dec 07,2018Â Â· 3.4 Selection of hardness of grinding wheel When grinding stainless steel,low hardness grinding wheels are used with better self sharpening.When the hardness is too low,the abrasive grains are not firmly bonded and fall off before being blunt,which will greatly reduce the service life of grinding wheels for stainless steel.Conclusions:Best Solo Method for XP grinding.
