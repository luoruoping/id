## Ball mill Wikipedia
For all nanocrystalline materials prepared by high energy ball milling synthesis route,surface and interface contamination is a major concern.In particular,mechanical attributed contamination by the milling tools (Fe or WC) as well as ambient gas (trace impurities such as O 2,N 2 in rare gases) can be problems for high energy ball milling.Machining Techniques In The Loupe Machinist BlogBall Nose Milling Without a Tilt Angle Ball nose end mills are ideal for machining 3 dimensional contour shapes typically found in the mold and die industry,the manufacturing of turbine blades,and fulfilling general part radius requirements.To properly employ a ball nose end mill (with no tilt angle) and gain the optimal tool life [.]
