## Process scale up and characterization of wood cellulose.
The paper discusses the isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC BE) from wood resources by integrating the processing with pilot scale bioethanol processing unit.The nanocrystals were isolated from cellulose obtained by acid pretreatment of wood chips in a bioethanol pilot scale facility,followed by a series of chemical processes and subsequent homogenization using a lab scale homogenizer.Review of Pilot Plant Programs for Bioethanol Conversion.The newer pilot plants are generally more flexible,highly instrumented,and able to investigate alternative process configurations than are the older plants.This chapter briefly reviews acid and enzymatic conversion technology and some of the many pilot plants that have been built for converting lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol.
