## Lime kiln Wikipedia
Shaft kilns.The theoretical heat (the standard enthalpy) of reaction required to make high calcium lime is around 3.15 MJ per kg of lime,so the batch kilns were only around 20% efficient.The key to development in efficiency was the invention of continuous kilns,avoiding the wasteful heat up and cool down cycles of the batch kilns.KILNS ThermopediaIn general,the word "kiln" is applied to devices for thermal processing of nonmetallic solids,and is particularly associated with the ceramic,cement and lime industries.The three principle types are vertical shaft kilns,rotary kilns and periodic kilns.
