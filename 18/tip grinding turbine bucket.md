## Pelton Wheel Turbine: Hydraulic Turbines in Hydroelectric.
In a Pelton Turbine or Pelton Wheel water jets impact on the blades of the turbine making the wheel rotate,producing torque and power.Learn more about design,analysis,working principle and applications of Pelton Wheel Turbine.Hydraulic Turbines are being used from very ancient times to harness the energy stored in flowing streams,rivers and lakes.Welding Pelton Runners HydroWorldConcerns over reliability of fully cast integral Pelton runners prompted one major manufacturer to explore alternatives that allow fabrication of the runner from stronger,more robust materials.Based on forging and welding practices,these techniques offer an alternative to traditional casting.
