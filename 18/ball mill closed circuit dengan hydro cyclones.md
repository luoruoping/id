## Measurement and modeling of residence time distribution of.
AbstractComparison between anticipated and measured mean residence time (MRT) along with analysis of the shape of residence time distribution (RTD) curves provides the most useful and valid information about mixing properties within a ball mill operating at industrial scale.In this work,the RTD measurements were carried out for a primary ball mill in closed circuit with hydrocyclones at two.Metso Ball MillsBall mills operate either in open or closed circuit.Open circuit operation is best utilized when: • Another stage of grinding follows the mill • Reduction ratio is small • Feed material is already fine and one pass through the mill produces the desired results •.
