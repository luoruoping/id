## Open pit mining Wikipedia
Open pit mining is to be considered one of the most dangerous sectors in the industrial world.It causes significant effects to miners health,as well as damage to the ecological land.Open pit mining causes changes to vegetation,soil,and bedrock,which ultimately contributes to changes in surface hydrology,groundwater levels,and flow paths.Mining Blasthole stoping BritannicaMining Mining Blasthole stoping: When the dip of a deposit is steep (greater than about 55°),ore and waste strong,ore boundaries regular,and the deposit relatively thick,a system called blasthole stoping is used.A drift is driven along the bottom of the ore body,and this is eventually enlarged into the shape of a trough.At the end of the trough,a raise is driven to the drilling.
