## Rod mills,how they function mine engineer
Rod mills are very similar to ball mills,except they use long rods for grinding media.The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill,similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill.To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling,the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.Grinding Mill Manufacturers Suppliers IQS DirectoryMany different kinds of grinding mills exist,including ball mills,hammermills,jaw crushers and roll crushers.A ball mill is a cylinder partially filled with a grinding medium,like small stainless steel balls.When rotated on its axis,the material that fills the rest of the cylinder is crushed.Hammermills instead use hammers to crush.
