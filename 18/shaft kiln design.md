## Lime Shaft Kiln,Cement Rotary kiln yuhongmachine
Lime shaft kiln,which also called vertical kiln,due to the vertical position of its kiln shell does not rotate,is always used to produce the products,such as cement,refractory materials (bauxite and mullite),lime,etc.Thus,the commonly used shaft kiln is also known as cement vertical kiln,lime vertical kiln.Kiln WikipediaThe Japanese Noborigama kiln is an evolution from Anagama design as a multi chamber kiln where wood is stacked from the front firebox at first,then only through the side stoking holes with the benefit of having air heated up to 600 °C (1,112 °F) from the front firebox,enabling more efficient firings.

## Lime kiln Wikipedia
Shaft kilns.The theoretical heat (the standard enthalpy) of reaction required to make high calcium lime is around 3.15 MJ per kg of lime,so the batch kilns were only around 20% efficient.The key to development in efficiency was the invention of continuous kilns,avoiding the wasteful heat up and cool down cycles of the batch kilns.Kiln Airflow Design Products Mechanical EngineeringTF Design Kilns incorporate direct mount fan motors inside the kiln as oppose to mounting the motors outside and connecting to the fan using a connecting shaft.This provides the following benefits: Reduced vibrations.[Fans & motors can be balanced perfectly and installed as a unit.] Improved shaft alignment [increased bearing reliability].
