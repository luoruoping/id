## Conveyor Capacity Engineering ToolBox
Conveyor capacity is determined by the belt speed,width and the angle of the belt and can be expressed as.Q = ρ A v (1) where.Q = conveyor capacity (kg s,lb s) ρ = density of transported material (kg m 3,lb ft 3) A = cross sectional area of the bulk solid on the belt (m 2,ft 2)Speed Rail Friction Conveyor MTCSpeed Rail Friction Conveyor.This is a high speed chain less overhead conveying system for long distance transportation or line feeding.It uses a Load bar driven by the Friction drive to which Components Assemblies are connected which travel across the assembly stations.
