Gold Well Vortex Drop Riffle Sluice Box.ANGLE: The sluice has been tested from 2 degrees through 25 degrees,and performs admirably throughout that range.This sluice has even been operated at a 45 degree angle and still captured gold,including fine gold.But for most purposes the angle of use should probably fall in the range of 5 to 15.How To Build and Operate Sluice BoxesGood examples of this box type are the 'DFS' (Damn Fine Sluice) and Steve Gaber's 'Pop and Son Sluice'.On the other hand boxes designed to concentrate gold particles of 16 mesh and up in size must have riffles but don't really have a need for the fine expanded metal mesh or even the Nomad matting though both are recommended.
