## Cone Crushers Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Cone crushers are used in AG and SAG grinding circuits to increase tonnage by effectively dealing with any pebble (critical size) build up problem.Normally,heavy duty short head crushers are employed to crush pebbles.Power and crusher cavity level are the key variables for monitoring and controlling the crusher operation.TC1000 Kimball Equipment Company Crushing and.The TC1000 Cone Crusher provides excellent reduction and product cubicity for the production of high quality aggregate and sub base material.The TC1000 is available in both short throw and long throw versions with a maximum capacity of 75 200 tph and 95 240 tph respectively.

## Discrete element modelling of a rock cone crusher.
A prototype DEM cone crusher has been successfully modelled using the PRM approach.• The effect of CSS and eccentric speed was compared favourably with literature data.• PRM is useful to predict cone crusher performance on product size distribution.Taurian EngineeringOur cone crushers have large feed size opening (to accept odd oversized material coming out of jaw crusher),and a large setting range to ensure that customer gets what he wants 0 20mm (concrete aggregates) or 0 40mm (road aggregates) or 0 70mm (road sub base).Cone Crushers,like jaw crushers,are compression crushers.
