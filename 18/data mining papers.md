## The top journals and conferences in data mining data.
A key question for data mining and data science researchers is to know what are the top journals and conferences in the field,since it is always best to publish in the most popular journals or conferences.In this blog post,I will look at four different rankings of data mining journals and conferences based on different criteria,and discuss these rankings.DATA MINING: CONCEPTS,BACKGROUND AND METHODS.In this paper,based on a broad view of data mining functionality,data mining is the process of discovering interesting knowledge from large amounts of data stored eith er in databases,data warehouses,or other information repositories [2].Figure 1.Knowledge Discovery in Databases [8]

## Survey of Clustering Data Mining Techniques
Survey of Clustering Data Mining Techniques Pavel Berkhin Accrue Software,Inc.Clustering is a division of data into groups of similar objects.Representing the data by fewer clusters necessarily loses certain fine details,but achieves simplification.It models data by its clusters.Data Mining Research PapersData mining techniques can be used to discover useful patterns that in turn can be used for classifying new data or other purpose.The algorithm for processing large set of data is scalable.Algorithm for processing data with changing pattern must be capable of incrementally learning and updating data patterns as new data become available.
