A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.There are two main forms of cement: Geopolymer cement and Portland Cement.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry,or with sand and gravel,produces concrete.Manufacturing process Lafarge Cement,concrete.The cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing,mainly limestone and clays.A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km.
