## The AFm phase in Portland cement ScienceDirect
Thus in Portland cement,the anions in AFm are hydroxide,sulfate and carbonate while in blended cement,e.g.slag cement,the characteristic anion is an aluminosilicate species.In service,chloride often displaces other anions.The content of AFm phase in hydrated pastes is variable but in many slag blended cements it may exceed 20%.Crystal Structures and Phase Transition of Cementitious Bi.I.Introduction.T he AFm phases are hydrated tetracalcium aluminate compounds belonging to the lamellar double hydroxide (LDH) family.They occur during the hydration process of many kinds of cement.AFm phases are composed of positively charged main layer [Ca 2 Al(OH) 6] + and negatively charged interlayer [X·nH 2 O] − where X is either one monovalent anion or half a divalent anion.
