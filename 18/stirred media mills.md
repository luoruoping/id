## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().Stirred Milling VERTIMILL® Grinding Mills & Stirred Media.Stirred Mills have been proven to provide energy savings compared with traditional ball mills.The finer the product required,the more efficient stirred mills will be than a ball mill.The attrition grinding action,vertical arrangement,and the finer media size distribution contribute to make stirred mills more energy efficient grinding machines.

## Stirred Milling Technology Swiss Tower Mills Minerals Ltd
Unlike tumbling mills,where comminution occurs from both impact and attrition grinding,in stirred media mills the particles suffer almost entirely attrition breakage between the beads.(Napier Munn et al.2005).In stirred mills there are no free falling possibilities for grinding media,meaning that impact action does not occur.Outotec HIGmill high intensity grinding mill OutotecHIGmill has a less complex and more compact process layout and flow sheet than other stirred media mills.The process comprises just a scalping cyclone,feed tank and pump,and the mill itself.The benefit of high power intensity and vertical installation is a very small footprint.

## What is the Stirred media mills? en.trituradoras de roca
Reply: Stirred media mills are usually constructed in the form of a cylindrical drum inside which there are a series of rods,arms or perforated discs which are rotated on a central shaft.The drum is loaded with grinding media,such as metal balls or glass sand.The media and the charge is 'stirred' together and thus the grinding takes place.iPAT Institut für Partikeltechnik der TU BraunschweigThe research on stirred media mills started 1978 in Braunschweig and it is still one of the main research areas of the Institute for Particle Technology.The importance of stirred media mills is still increasing although the first stirred media mills were developed in the 1950´s.
