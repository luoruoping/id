## ISR Mining Uranium One
Conventional mining involves extracting ore from the ground and processing it to extract the target minerals.ISR (in situ leaching,also known as in situ recovery (ISR) or solution mining) involves using liquids (commonly referred to as "leaching liquors" or "lixivants"),which are pumped through the orebody while it is in the ground to recover the minerals from the ore by leaching.Chapter 6 Copper Production TechnologyTypes of in Situ Leaching Systems.124 Chapter 6 Copper Production Technology whenopen pit mining,flo

## leaching system mining
Heap leaching Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia.Heap leaching is an industrial mining process to extract precious metals,copper,uranium,and other compounds from ore via a series of chemical reactions thatCyanide Leaching Of Gold mine engineerMost cyanide leaching is carried out at a alkaline pH of between 10 and 11,depending upon lab testing of individual ores and the optimum leaching chemical use rates.The cyanide solution strength is also important in leaching gold,with the typical range of solution being in the 0.02% 0.05% NaCN.
