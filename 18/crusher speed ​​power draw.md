## 11 tips for maximizing cone crusher productivity.
Dec 05,2016 · Typical reasons for adjustment ring movement or excessive power draw are tramp events,poor feed distribution,segregation of the feed,too many fines in the feed,high moisture content,wrong mantle and bowl liner being used or simply trying to operate at an unrealistically small closed side setting.9.Monitor and maintain a proper crusher speed.Maximize your cone crusher productivity : Pit & QuarryApr 28,2017 · A power draw of 75 to 95 percent is a great target range to stay within while crushing.Excessive power peaks,particularly above 110 percent rated horsepower,should be avoided as this could lead to premature crusher failure.4.Ensure the feed is evenly distributed.

## Cone Crusher an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Unlike a gyratory crusher,which is identified by the dimensions of the feed opening and the mantle diameter,a cone crusher is rated by the diameter of the cone mantle.Cone crushers are also identified by the power draw: for example,the Metso MP1000 refers to 1,000 HP (746 kW),and the FLSmidth XL2000 refers to 2,000 HP (1,491 kW).Ball Mill Critical Speed & Working Principle YouTubeJun 19,2015 · The implications for machine performance are first; that power draw will vary with different original liner designs,as well as throughout the wear life,depending on the wear pattern; and.
