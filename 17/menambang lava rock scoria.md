## What Is Pumice Rock? Geology and Uses thoughtco
Scoria or "lava rock" forms when dissolved gases in magma come out of solution,producing bubbles that are frozen in shape when the molten rock cools.Like pumice,scoria contains porous vesicles.However,the walls of the vesicles are thicker.Thus,scoria is darker in color (black,purplish red,dark brown) and more dense than water (sinks).Scoria WikipediaScoria is a highly vesicular,dark colored volcanic rock that may or may not contain crystals (phenocrysts).It is typically dark in color (generally dark brown,black or purplish red),and basaltic or andesitic in composition.Scoria is relatively low in density as a result of its numerous macroscopic ellipsoidal vesicles,but in contrast to pumice,all scoria has a specific gravity greater.
