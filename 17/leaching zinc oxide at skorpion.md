## Skorpion zinc: Optimization and innovation J.Gnoinski.
The Skorpion process comprises three processing steps atmospheric leaching in sulfuric acid,zinc solvent extraction and electrowinning to produce special high grade zinc.LEACHING Zn FROM THE LOW GRADE ZINC OXIDE ORE IN NH3.However,the zinc leaching efficiency remained in a stable range of approximately 5:1.This observation may point toward a possible cause of the difficult leaching characteristics of zinc oxide ore in the NH 3 H 3 C 6 H 5 O 7 H 2 O system.At a low liquid solid ratio (from 3:1 to 5:1),the zinc ion concentration in the solution increased rapidly.

## Recycling Zinc from Metal Oxide Varistors Through Leaching.
Metal oxide varistors (MOVs) are housed in a surge arrestor and composed of zinc oxide (>90 wt%) and other metal oxides such as antimony,bismuth,cobalt,manganese,and nickel.Due to the high concentration of zinc in MOVs,it is a better choice to recycle them as opposed to landfilling.Zinc WikipediaZinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber to disburse heat.Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV).The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products.

## Zinc smelting Wikipedia
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals,e.g.iron,because in contrast,zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals,zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost,unless specific.A Study on Leaching of Zinc Oxide Ore in Ammonium Sulfate.In this paper,the leaching effect of zinc oxide ore was investigated using ammonium sulfate solution as leaching agent.The effects of temperature,concentration of ammonium sulfate,average particle size and stirring speed on the leaching of zinc oxide ore were studied.The leaching rate increased with increasing solution temperature,concentration,and stirring speed as well as with.
