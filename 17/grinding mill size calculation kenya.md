## Grinding Mills 911Metallurgist
Mill sizing for most grinding installations is usually arrived at through calculations involving required throughput,ore work index estimates,and feed and product size distribution requirements.This information is then tempered with experience to arrive at actual mill size recommendations.GROSS POWER CALCULATOR SMC TestingGROSS POWER CALCULATOR General This model uses the equations from Morrell's 1993 PhD thesis: "The Prediction of Power Draw in Wet Tumbling Mills".The model is also described in detail in the book "Mineral Comminution Circuits Their Operation and Optimisation" which is available from the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre.

## Comparison of grinding media—Cylpebs versus balls
Grinding media exert a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on mill ing performance in terms of product size,energy con sumption and grinding costs due to media wear.Grinding balls and rods are traditionally used as grind ing media in the mineral industry.In the recent years other grinding.GROSS POWER CALCULATOR smctestingcalculations by the user.If the mill has cone ends the model automatically calculates the volume of the cone ends as well as the volume of balls rock in the cone ends from the cylindrical section data that the user inputs.In SAG mills the total filling relates to the combined rock and ball volume (including voids),
