## THE HARDNESS OF ROCKS AND MINERALS gemcutters
In a coarse grained rock,identifying the individual minerals allows you to identify the rock.If the rock is fine grained,it's harder to interpret the results.The hardness of fine grained rocks tends to reflect the average hardness of the minerals in them.Shales are made mostly of clay and tend to be soft.Missouri Limestone Missouri Department of Natural ResourcesMain Uses of Limestone: In Missouri,limestone of all kinds is used mainly for aggregate (aka "gravel") that is produced by crushing and screen sizing limestone quarry rock.The aggregate is used in concrete,for road surfacing (with or without asphalt or tar binder),and for foundation support beneath weight bearing structures.

## The Strength and Hardness Ratings of Granite and Marble
Marble is limestone that has been compacted and heated over millions of years.As a result,marble is less porous and slightly stronger than limestone,but still less durable than granite.Depending on the limestone and the mineral combination within the marble,most marble rates from three to five on the Mohs hardness scale.
