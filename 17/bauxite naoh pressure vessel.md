## Processing of Bauxite Ores Mine Engineer.Com
The processing begins with crushing to 1 2 inch particles and wet screening,to remove some silica fines,which are generally present with bauxite.From here,the ore is digested in a heated,pressurized vessel at temperatures up to 450 defrees F and pressures of 500 psi.Analysis of bauxite residue components responsible for.Bauxite residue is a solid waste produced during the Bayer process employed for alumina production (Kong et al.2018; Zhu et al.2016,2017).In the Bayer process,bauxite ore is mixed with sodium hydroxide and lime,and heated in a pressure vessel at a temperature of 240 300 °C.
