From the chief scientist Ahmad Shayan research,using waste glass powder in concrete also gives a good result and has a high potential to increase the concrete strength with reducing the usage of 100% Portland cement.From his lab test,he found that it is better to grind the waste glass into a fine glass powder (GLP) forPowder metallurgy basics & applicationsalumina,zirconia.During rolling of vessel,the grinding media & powder particles roll from some height.This process grinds the powder materials by impact collision & attrition.• Milling can be dry milling or wet milling.In dry milling,about 25 vol% of powder is added along with about 1 wt% of a lubricant such as stearic or oleic acid.
