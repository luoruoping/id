## Comparison between Flexible Pavement and rigid pavement in.
Apr 27,2015 · Comparison between Flexible Pavement and rigid pavement in highway construction.A typical flexible pavement structure consists of the surface course and underlying base and sub base courses.Each of these layers contributes to structural support and drainage.Full Depth Reclamation Reclamation,LLCFull depth reclamation can result in up to 20 years of extended lifespan to the original construction by eliminating pavement distress factors such as alligator,fatigue,thermal,transverse,longitudinal and reflective cracking.In a world where highway funding is scarce and "green" is the future,you can't afford NOT to recycle your roads!
