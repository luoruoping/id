## Ion exchange isotherms in solid: electrolyte solution systems
It is shown show that the ion exchange isotherms and the law of mass action are equivalent,the c a versus c functions can be derived from the law of mass action (c and a: the concentration of ions in ion exchanger and solution,respectively).Measurements on Cation Exchange Capacity of Bentonite.Measurements on Cation Exchange Capacity of Bentonite in the Long Term Test of Buffer Material (LOT) ABSTRACT Determination of cation exchange capacity (CEC) of bentonite in the LOT experiment was the topic of this study.The measurements were performed using the complex of copper(II) ion with trietylenetetramine [Cu(trien)]2+ as the index.

## Bentonite Wikipedia
Calcium bentonite may be converted to sodium bentonite (termed sodium beneficiation or sodium activation) to exhibit many of sodium bentonite's properties by an ion exchange process.In common usage,this means adding 5 10% of a soluble sodium salt such as sodium carbonate to wet bentonite,mixing well,and allowing time for the ion exchange.Cation Exchange Properties of Bentonite The Journal of.Citation data is made available by participants in Crossref's Cited by Linking service.For a more comprehensive list of citations to this article,users are encouraged to perform a search inSciFinder.

Cation Exchange Capacity.Two types of analysis are used to measure the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of materials.The first,and preferred method,uses cobalt hexammine trichloride whilst the second is the methlyene blue method.What is Bentonite? What is Montmorillonite Clay MineralsIn other words,we've talked to people who didn't want bentonite,but instead montmorillonite,and those who have rejected montmorillonite because it wasn't labelled as bentonite.Bentonites (and montmorillonites) are further classified by their dominant cation (the element in the clay that has the highest potential for ion exchange).
