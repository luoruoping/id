## Cationic Surfactants an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The ion pair extraction technique has proved suited for the determination of cationic surfactants by two phase titrations and or by spectrophotometry (the method is based on extraction of an ion pair between surfactant and dye,which is the basis of the well known Epton Methylene blue and The Cosmetic,Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA) mixed indicator method).Testing for Surfactants and Quats with TitrationDue to its simplicity and accuracy,titration is a great fit for determining the active components in anionic and cationic surfactants.In this method,the cationic or anionic surfactant is simply titrated with its counterpart.In other words,cationic surfactants are titrated with anionic surfactants and vice versa.
