## Flotation of Pyrite Metallurgist & Mineral Processing.
Sodium silicate was somewhat effective in causing a differential or selective flotation of copper,as chalcopyrite from pyrite by keeping pyrite from floating.Sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide gave,in most cases,a distinct separation of sphalerite from chalcopyrite; i.e.a high copper and low zinc by suppressing the flotation of sphalerite.Pyrite Group: Mineral information,data and localities.Group of isostructural sulphide species sharing the Pa 3 space group,with a diploidal structure in which the "A" atoms occupy a face centred cubic lattice position and the "X" atoms are in dumbbell like pairs parallel to the four cube diagonals of the lattice,with each "A" atom surrounded by six "X" atoms in octahedral coordination each pair of "X" atoms coordinated to six "A" atoms.

## Chalcopyrite Wikipedia
Chalcopyrite ( ˌ k æ l k ə ˈ p aɪ r aɪ t, k oʊ KAL ko PY ryt) is a copper iron sulfide mineral that crystallizes in the tetragonal system.It has the chemical formula CuFeS 2.It has a brassy to golden yellow color and a hardness of 3.5 to 4 on the Mohs scale.Its streak is diagnostic as green tinged black.Marcasite mineral BritannicaMarcasite is found with lead and zinc minerals in metalliferous veins,as at Galena,Ill.U.S.and at Clausthal Zellerfeld and Linnich,Ger.Marcasite,which has the same chemical formula as pyrite (FeS 2) but crystallizes in the orthorhombic instead of the isometric system,alters upon weathering to ferrous sulfate and sulfuric acid.
