## Design and Analysis of Vertical Axis Wind Turbine Blades.
design of a vertical axis Savonius Darrieus integrated Wind Turbine is proposed to be mounted on a Streetlight pole.Important aspects about street lighting and wind data are discussed.The blade geometry (Troposkein shape) for the Darrieus rotor is approximated by an iterative method.The entire Design process is performed for two materials:Improvement of the aerodynamic performance of vertical.The flow performance of vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) is significantly deteriorated by dynamic stall at low tip speed ratios (TSR).Dynamic stall occurs periodically during the rotation of turbine blades and generates flow separations formed at leading edges,which results in tremendous fluctuations in torque and essential reduction in power outputs.
