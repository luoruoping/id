## The 45 Degree Line of Economics Definition Bizfluent
The 45 degree line of economics is so named because it forms a 45 degree angle with both the x and y axes when charted.In Keynesian economics,this line illustrates all of the points at which aggregate expenditures,measured on the y,or vertical axis,are equal to aggregate production,which are measured on the x,or horizontal axis.Techniks High Performance Aggregate Heads for CNC RoutersTechniks provides the highest quality and broadest range of aggregates available.Call us to speak to an aggregate head specialist.We build aggregates for virtually any application.

## Degree (angle) Wikipedia
A degree (in full,a degree of arc,arc degree,or arcdegree),usually denoted by ° (the degree symbol),is a measurement of a plane angle,defined so that a full rotation is 360 degrees.It is not an SI unit,as the SI unit of angular measure is the radian,but it is mentioned in the SI brochure as an accepted unit.Facts & Figures KPI JCI and Astec Mobile Screensscreening plants,pugmill plants,sand and aggregate washing classifying systems and all types of mobile,portable and stationary aggregate processing plants for the aggregate,recycle and construction industries.KPI JCI and Astec Mobile Screens has made every effort to present the information contained in this booklet accurately.
