## Surface mining Wikipedia
"Strip mining" is the practice of mining a seam of mineral,by first removing a long strip of overlying soil and rock (the overburden).It is most commonly used to mine coal and lignite (brown coal).Strip mining is only practical when the ore body to be excavated is relatively near the surface.Fees Associated with Mining ActivitiesA mining permit requires additional authorizations concurrent with the mining application.For example,all operators require a mining license,and permits 1 acre or greater must have an associated NPDES permit (individual or general).Water obstructions,or general permit requests can be submitted with the mining applications.
