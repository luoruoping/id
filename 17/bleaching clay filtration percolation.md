## A study of bleach clay solubility ScienceDirect
A STUDY OF BLEACH CLAY SOLUBILITY.BY P.G.NUTTING.* ABSTRACT.The five varieties of bleach clays indicated by leach and bleach tests are all dominantly montmorillonite and are not readily distinguishable by X ray tests,petrography,by chemical analyses or thermal dehydration curves.T 41 Acid Activated Bleaching Clay Shop Laboratory.Acid activated bentonite clay (or activated bleaching clay) is an excellent filtration media.The clay is rich in carbon,and it has a low pH.This product is most commonly used during oil purification,distillation preparation,pesticide removal,and product improvement (odor removal).
