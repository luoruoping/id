## Iron processing Ores Britannica
The most widely distributed iron bearing minerals are oxides,and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3),which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4),which is black; limonite or bog iron ore (2Fe2O3·3H2O),which is brown; and siderite (FeCO3),which is pale brown.Hematite and magnetite are by far the most common types of ore.Iron ore WikipediaCurrently magnetite iron ore is mined in Minnesota and Michigan in the U.S.Eastern Canada and Northern Sweden.Magnetite bearing banded iron formation is currently mined extensively in Brazil,which exports significant quantities to Asia,and there is a nascent and large magnetite iron ore industry in Australia.Direct shipping (hematite) ores
