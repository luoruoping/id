## Lime Production from Limestone Current Technology
Limestone is a source of calcium carbonate and is heated to convert the calcium carbonate into calcium oxide.This process is generally carried out in large rotary kilns or vertical shaft kilns where high temperature is required.Quicklime is produced in the calcination process,which can be crushed depending on it's use.Lime calcining systems MetsoLime calcining is the conversion of limestone (CaCO3) to lime (CaO).Limestone is a sedimentary rock,the third most abundant mineral.Limestone is mostly quarried above ground; however,some underground limestone mining is done.Limestone is found with many different characteristics and different impurities.

One of the most common applications is for the sulfite pulping process.This process uses acid to dissolve the glue (lignin) that holds the fibers (cellulose) together.When acidic water discharged from this process is neutralized,lime is the reagent of choice in order to safely elevate the pH of the effluent stream prior to discharge.What is Lime? GraymontThe word "lime" refers to products derived from burnt (calcined) limestone,such as quicklime and hydrated lime.Limestone is a naturally occurring and abundant sedimentary rock consisting of high levels of calcium and or magnesium carbonate,and or dolomite (calcium and magnesium carbonate),along with small amounts of other minerals.
