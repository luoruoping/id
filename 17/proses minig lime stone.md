## Lime Production from Limestone Current Technology
Limestone is a source of calcium carbonate and is heated to convert the calcium carbonate into calcium oxide.This process is generally carried out in large rotary kilns or vertical shaft kilns where high temperature is required.Quicklime is produced in the calcination process,which can be crushed depending on it's use.Lime calcining systems MetsoLime calcining is the conversion of limestone (CaCO3) to lime (CaO).Limestone is a sedimentary rock,the third most abundant mineral.Limestone is mostly quarried above ground; however,some underground limestone mining is done.Limestone is found with many different characteristics and different impurities.
