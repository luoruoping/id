## Magnetite & Lodestone Mineral Photos,Uses,Properties
Use of Magnetite as an Ore of Iron.Most of the iron ore mined today is a banded sedimentary rock known as taconite that contains a mixture of magnetite,hematite,and chert.Once considered a waste material,taconite became an important ore after higher grade deposits were depleted.Today's commercial taconites contain 25 to 30% iron by weight.Magnetite Mid Georgia Gem and Mineral SocietyMost of the iron ore mined today is a banded sedimentary rock known as taconite that contains a mixture of magnetite,hematite,and chert.Once considered a waste material,taconite became an important ore after higher grade deposits were depleted.Today's commercial taconites contain 25 to 30% iron.
