## Drilling Wikipedia
Drilling is a cutting process that uses a drill bit to cut a hole of circular cross section in solid materials.The drill bit is usually a rotary cutting tool,often multi point.The bit is pressed against the work piece and rotated at rates from hundreds to thousands of revolutions per minute.This forces the cutting edge against the work piece,cutting off chips (swarf) from the hole as it is.Biofuel POETThe major steps in the POET dry mill process are: MILLING: The feedstock passes through a hammer mill,which grinds it into a fine powder called flour.FERMENTATION: Enzymes and water are added to convert starch into glucose,or simple sugars.Yeast is added to the mash to convert the sugars to ethanol and carbon dioxide.
