## PARTICLE SIZE AND SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF SUPERABRASIVE.
PARTICLE SIZE CHARACTERIZATION Knowledge of particle size and size distribution of a powder system is a prerequisite for most production and processing operations.Particle size and size distribution have a significant effect on the surface and bulk properties (mechanical,electrical,thermal),of the finished product.In most instances powder.Interpon USA Powder ParticlesIt is generally easier to obtain a smooth film with a narrow particle size band distribution,especially at low particle size cuts,e.g.10 20µ,than it is at wider or higher particle size distribution.However,powder of the lower particle sizes have to be specially formulated to apply using existing spray application equipment.
