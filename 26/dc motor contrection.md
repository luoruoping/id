The disadvantages of permanent magnet motors are a limited ability to accelerate inertial loads and a high sensitivity to the parameters of voltage and phasing capacitor.The first of these problems may be minimized by gearing or in some cases flexible TheBasic comparison between ac and dc motor.The basic construction difference between ac and dc motor is that dc motor has direct conduction current supply to rotor and ac motor has inductive supply to rotor no direct conduct.A motor needs three basic thingsA magnetic field,a current carrying conductor,harnessing the created force on current carrying conductor due to magnetic field in ways to create rotary motion hence generate torque.
