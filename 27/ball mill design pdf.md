TECHNICAL NOTES 8 GRINDING R.P.King.82 Figure 8.5 Effect of mill filling on power draft for ball mills.The data is taken from Rexnord Process MachineryGrinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process ControlThe design of a ball mill can vary significantly depending on the size,the equipment used to load the starting material (feeders),and the system for discharging the output product.The size of a mill is usually characterized by the ratio “length to diameter” and this ratio most frequently varies from 0.5 to 3.5.TheBall mill is the key equipment for re crushing the materials after they are primarily crushed.Ball mill is widely used for the dry type or wet type grinding of all kinds of ores and other grind able materials in cement,silicate product,new building material,refractory,fertilizer,black and non ferrous metals and glass ceramic industry.
