## What are the different types of coal? American.
The coal formation process involves the burial of peat,which is made of partly decayed plant materials,deep underground.The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat,which transforms it into coal,a type of sedimentary rock.This process takes millions of years.Types,or "ranks," of coal are determined by carbon content.There are four.Coal in a NutshellJan 23,2020 · Coal comes in three main types or grades.First,the swampy peat is squeezed and heated to form brown,soft coal called lignite.In the process,the material releases hydrocarbons,which migrate away and eventually become petroleum.With more heat and pressure lignite releases more hydrocarbons and becomes the higher grade bituminous coal.

## Anthracite Coal Characteristics and Applications
Anthracite also is the most brittle among coal types.When burned,it produces a very hot,blue flame.A shiny black rock,anthracite is used primarily for heating residential and commercial buildings in the northeastern region of Pennsylvania,where much of it is mined.Coal: Anthracite,Bituminous,Coke,Pictures,Formation,UsesCoal Forming Environments: A generalized diagram of a swamp,showing how water depth,preservation conditions,plant types,and plant productivity can vary in different parts of the swamp.These variations will yield different types of coal.Illustration by the West Virginia Geological and Economic Survey.
