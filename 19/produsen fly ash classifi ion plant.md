## What are Class F Fly Ash and Class C Fly Ash?
The glassy silica and alumina of Class F fly ash requires a cementing agent,such as Portland cement,quicklime,or hydrated lime,with the presence of water in order to react and produce cementitious compounds.Class C Fly Ash: Fly ash produced from the burning of younger lignite or subbituminous coal,in addition to having pozzolanic.Where Has the Fly Ash Gone?Where Has the Fly Ash Gone? Pending EPA regulations and an unseasonably mild winter in Texas have dramatically.impacted the availability of fly ash during the first few months of 2012.The Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR),scheduled to become effective on January 1,2012,would have eliminated two Class F fly ash sources.

## Uses,Benefits,and Drawbacks of Fly Ash in Construction
Fly ash is a fine powder that is a byproduct of burning pulverized coal in electric generation power plants.Fly ash is a pozzolan,a substance containing aluminous and siliceous material that forms cement in the presence of water.When mixed with lime and water,fly ash forms a compound similar to Portland cement.CHARACTERIZATION OF FLY ASHES FROM THERMAL POWER.characterization of fly ashes from thermal power plants in turkey a thesis submitted to the graduate school of natural and applied sciences of

## Coal Ash (Coal Combustion Residuals,or CCR) US EPA
Coal combustion residuals,commonly known as coal ash,are created when coal is burned by power plants to produce electricity.Coal ash is one of the largest types of industrial waste generated in the United States.In 2012,470 coal fired electric utilities generated about 110 million tons of coal.Potential Hazards of Fly Ash How Fly Ash Concrete Works.Of course,fly ash isn't without controversy.Because fly ash is a byproduct of coal,which itself is full of heavy metals and toxins that can be dangerous,concern has been raised that buildings made from fly ash concrete could be harmful to people.The biggest challenge to fly ash came in 2008.

III.CLASSIFICATION OF FLY ASH Two classes of fly ash are defined by ASTM C618: Class F fly ash and Class C fly ash.The chief difference between these classes is the amount of calcium,silica,alumina,and iron content in the ash.The chemical properties of the fly ash are largely influenced by the chemical content of the coal burned.Processed Low NOx Fly Ash as a Filler in Plasticsx fly ash at pilot plant scale.As a result the loss on ignition (LOI) of the fly ash received from American Electric Power Company (AEP) has been reduced from 23.3% to 1.2%.A potential application for fly ash,other than as a substitute for cement,is to use the resulting clean ash as a plastic filler.
