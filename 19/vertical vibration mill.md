## Vertical vibration of strip mill with the piecewise.
Abstract.Vertical vibration model of strip mill is established by considering piecewise nonlinear constraint arising from hydraulic cylinder.The approximate analytical solution of the model is obtained by incremental harmonic balance (IHB) method.Vertical Vibration Model for Unsteady Lubrication in Rolls.According to the vertical vibration phenomena existing in cold rolling mills,the unsteady lubrication mechanism in roll gap and its influence to rolling stability was chosen as the case for analysis.On the basis of rolling theory,lubrication and friction theory,and mechanic vibration theory,the vertical vibration model for unsteady lubrication in rolls strip interface was presented.
