## The cement mill
Grinding systems are either 'open circuit' or 'closed circuit.' In an open circuit system,the feed rate of incoming clinker is adjusted to achieve the desired fineness of the product.In a closed circuit system,coarse particles are separated from the finer product and returned for further grinding.IsaMill4 Open Circuit con˜guration Feed to the IsaMill™ passes through 8 consecutive grinding stages between the discs before it reaches the internal classi˜er.Other mills with just one grinding stage require closed circuit cyclones and high recirculating loads and still don't produce product size distributions as steep as the IsaMill™.5.
