The Inca knew there was something sinister about the cinnabar they hauled out of the ground at Huancavelica in Peru hundreds of years ago.They called the mine the Mine of Death.Now,a new study has exposed a 3,500 year history of mercury pollution from the cinnabar mines,a much longer legacy than researchers had previously realized.Mercury Mining Encyclopedia of ArkansasMercury,which was first mined in Arkansas in 1931,is in most rock types in trace amounts,generally occurring at higher levels in shale and clay rich sediments and organic materials like coal than in sandstone,limestone,or dolostone.Although mercury was widely used in the past for several applications,the market for products containing mercury steadily declined in the 1980s because it.

## Cinnabar: A toxic ore of mercury,once used as a pigment
Cinnabar is the only important ore of mercury.For thousands of years,cinnabar has been mined and heated in a furnace.The mercury escapes as a vapor that can be condensed into liquid mercury.People began using cinnabar for pigments thousands of years ago in Italy,Greece,Spain,China,Turkey,and the Mayan countries of South America.Mining in Lewis Co.WAWhile the mining industry never reached the same prominence that logging did in Lewis County,it was an important source of revenue in the early 1900s,especially in the area in and around Morton,where multiple cinnabar veins were mined (cinnabar is the common ore of mercury).
