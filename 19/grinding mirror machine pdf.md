## Grinding Machines an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Grinding machines,like broaching machines,operate over a range of speeds depending on the type of machine being used.These range from approximately 1250 to 2000m min −1,although in high speed grinding speeds of up to 5400m min are achievable (Schey,1987).The two most common grinding applications are cylindrical grinding and surface grinding.Metallographic grinding and polishing insight Struers.comA fast and efficient semi automatic grinding and polishing machine,ideal for labs and workplaces that prepare a high volume of specimens.LaboSystem.A modular manual semi automatic grinding and polishing system with a choice of polishers,specimen movers.

## Basics of Grinding
grinding machines perform the dressing task automatically.The application of coolants to the grinding process is important.Coolants reduce grinding machine power requirements,maintain work quality,stabilize part dimensions,and insure longer wheel life.Coolants are either emulsions,synthetic lubricants or special grinding oils.Lens & Mirror Making Best lenses and mirrors are both made.Lens & Mirror Making • Best lenses and mirrors are both made by grinding the surface • Start with a mirror or lens blank • For mirrors only surface needs to be good • Typical mirror want pyrex (eg BK7) • Then need a tool blank poorer glass & softer glass • Place mirror on top tool • Now add grinding compound (grit) between.
