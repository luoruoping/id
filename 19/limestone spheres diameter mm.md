## 5mm Diameter Tungsten Carbide Balls Ball and Roller.
Balls made from this material are used for applications requiring extreme hardness and resistance to wear and abrasion,hard shocks and impacts.Tungsten carbide is generally 3 times harder than steel.Applications include special valves,flow meters,re circulating ball screws,linear bearings etc.They are also used for calibrating or measuring.2.POROSITYdiameter ratio.This minimum occurs at approximately 20 to 30% of the smaller particle diameter.In real rocks we have a continuous spectrum of grain sizes,and these can give rise to a complex scenario,where fractal concepts become useful.Figure 2.4 Apparent volume for assemblages of spheres of different diameter ratios.

## EFFECT OF THE PARTICLE SIZE ON FLOTATION.
upgradation of limestone can be done by many ways.One alternative is to use crushed limestone to 3 mm size and process it in scrubber and classifier,while the other entails grinding of raw feed to less than 200 mesh and carry out beneficiation by froth flotation [14,15].Similarly,a low grade siliceous limestonePortland limestone Simple English Wikipedia,the free.These became coated with layers of lime mud,and formed small balls (less than 0.5 mm diameter).Over time,countless billions of these balls,known as "ooids" or "ooliths",became partly cemented together by more calcite,to form the oolitic limestone we call Portland limestone.
