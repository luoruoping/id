## 11.23 Taconite Ore Processing US EPA
Processing of taconite consists of crushing and grinding the ore to liberate iron bearing particles,concentrating the ore by separating the particles from the waste material (gangue),and pelletizing the iron ore concentrate.A simplified flow diagram of these processing steps is shown in Figure 11.23 1.Dense Medium Separation An Effective and Robust Pre.With energy costs increasing and ore grades diminishing,the role of pre concentration in hard rock mining operations has been gaining greater interest.To maximize energy conservation,the pre concentration process should be conducted at as coarse a crush size as possible while minimizing losses of pay metals.Dense medium separation (DMS) is.
