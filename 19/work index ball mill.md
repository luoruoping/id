The Bond Ball Work Index Test determines the resistance of ore to grinding in a ball mill,expressed as a work index kilo Watt hour per ton (kWh t).The work index is then used to calculate the specific energy requirements for sizing ball mills or determining their throughput for a target grind.Ball mill WikipediaA ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.
