GeologyWhat is Spodumene? Spodumene is a pyroxene mineral that is typically found in lithium rich pegmatites.It is usually associated with other lithium minerals such as lepidolite,eucryptite,and petalite.Spodumene has a chemical composition of LiAlSi 2 O 6 but small amounts of sodium sometimes substitute for lithium.

Emerald Mining In Zimbabwe.A modern map of Zimbabwe and its shared border with another emerald producer,Zambia.Emeralds have been found at several locations in Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia).One important source of superb quality emeralds,usually small in size,is the Sandawana mine field.Hard Rock Lithium Processing sgsminerals are found in granitic pegmatites.The most important of these minerals are spodumene (Li 2 O,Al 2 O 3.4SiO 2) and petalite (Li 2 O,Al 2 O 3.8SiO 2).Spodumene has a theoretical Li2O content of 8.03%.Due to its high lithium content,spodumene is considered the most important lithium ore mineral.A typical run of mine ore can.

## Geology and formation of Zambian gemstones
Huge intrusions like the Sinda batholith in the Southeast of Zambia are believed to have provided the residual melts and hydrothermal fluids (water and gases) from which the pegmatites formed.By slowly cooling down rock forming minerals,e.g.quartz,feldspar and mica crystallised in.
