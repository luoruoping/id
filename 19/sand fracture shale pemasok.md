## Fracking Sand in Hydraulic Fracturing The Balance
Fracking sand (or frac sand) refers to sand and similar small materials used during the process of hydraulic fracturing.Fracking is a method for extracting underground oil and natural gas from shale.Fracturing CPEOThe fluid is pumped from the fracture,leaving permeable subsurface channels.The hydraulic fracturing process is repeated at varying depths (typically 5 to 30 ft) creating a "stack" of sand filled fractures.This technology is used primarily to fracture silts,clays,shale,and bedrock.

## What is hydraulic fracturing?
Hydraulic fracturing,informally referred to as "fracking," is an oil and gas well development process that typically involves injecting water,sand,and chemicals under high pressure into a bedrock formation via the well.This process is intended to create new fractures in the rock as well as increase the size,extent,and connectivity of existing fractures.Hydraulic fracturing WikipediaHydraulic fracturing (also fracking,fraccing,frac'ing,hydrofracturing or hydrofracking) is a well stimulation technique in which rock is fractured by a pressurized liquid.The process involves the high pressure injection of 'fracking fluid' (primarily water,containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep rock.
