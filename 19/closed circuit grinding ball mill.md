## A survey on troubleshooting of closed circuit grinding.
An industrial ball mill operating in closed circuit with hydrocyclones was studied by five sampling surveys.The aim of the present study was to optimise operating parameters (i.e.charge volume,make up ball size regime,slurry mean residence time,number of hydrocyclones in operation and hydrocyclone's feed solids content (S f)) with respect to increasing throughout from 225 to 300 tons.IsaMillfundamentally different from a ball mill.The impact mechanism and long residence times in ball mills cause indiscriminate grinding and poor size distributions.This generates slimes,wastes energy and increases reagent consumption.Furthermore,closed circuit cyclones used in ball and tower mill circuits use considerable amounts of energy
