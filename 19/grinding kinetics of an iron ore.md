## Kinetics of Iron Ore Reduction by Methane for Chemical.
The iron oxide in the ore,which is initially Fe2O3,proceeds through a sequence of reaction steps and can ultimately end up as metallic iron.The reduction mechanism for the first stage reaction (i.e.Fe2O3 to Fe3O4) was evaluated using a number of different.Mill (grinding) WikipediaA rotating drum causes friction and attrition between steel rods and ore particles.[citation needed] But note that the term 'rod mill' is also used as a synonym for a slitting mill,which makes rods of iron or other metal.Rod mills are less common than ball mills for grinding minerals.
