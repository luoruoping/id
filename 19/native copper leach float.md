## Copper mining in Michigan Wikipedia
Native Americans were the first to mine and work the copper of Lake Superior and the Keweenaw Peninsula of northern Michigan between 5000 BCE and 1200 BCE.The natives used this copper to produce tools.Archaeological expeditions in the Keweenaw Peninsula and Isle Royale revealed the existence of copper producing pits and hammering stones which were used to work the copper.Introduction to Mineral Processing cpchemOxide copper ore,low grade copper sulfide overburden,and other copper containing materials are stacked into a heap.Leach solution (pH approximately 2) is sprinkled or flooded on top of the heap and percolates through.The leach solution containing the dissolved metal eventually flows out of the heap into a collection pond.

Jun 23,2002 · The Copper Rich Keweenaw During the latest heyday of regional copper mining in the Upper Peninsula from 1845 to 1968,more than 11 billion pounds of native copper were extracted,mainly in the Keweenaw and Ontonagon County to the southwest.But copper extraction came with prehistoric people more than 10,000 years ago,including on Isle Royale.Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & ExtractionThe barren rock,or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore.By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper,iron and sometimes other metals.Such ores originate from sulfur bearing volcanic magmas,which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.

Experiments on ammonium carbonate leachng of native copper ores crushed to 1 inch size showed that in 30 days 55 percent of the copper was extracted from 0.7 percent copper conglomerate type ore,and 85 percent was extracted from 2.1 percent copper amygdaloid type ore.Native Copper Flotation Froth Flotation (Sulphide.Froth Flotation (Sulphide & Oxide) Froth Flotation.and stage added dodecyl mercaptan as collector for the native copper.The native copper would tend to float in the scavenger circuit,but would tend to concentrate itself in the regrind circuit,and often fell out in the re cleaner circuit (if it made it that far!).
