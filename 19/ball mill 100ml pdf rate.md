In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize "just in case".Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and tear.Choosing Cutting Parameters Calculating Cutting Speed and.f is the feed rate multiplier coefficient taking into consideration that chip load is less than theoretical value.Take the value of K f from Table 5 or Table 6.3.Calculate Spindle Speed Use the formula: N = SFM x 3.82 (÷Dw) Table 3 Working Diameter For Ball Nose Tools ØD 0.250 0.312 0.375 0.500 0.625 0.750 1.000 1.250 Depth of cut
