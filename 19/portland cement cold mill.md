Manufacturing of Portland Cement The details of the cement making process vary widely.However,the fundamental stages in cement production are all the same and as follow.A schematic diagram of the cement manufacturing is shown in Fig.3.1.• 1.The raw materials are reduced to fine particle size.• 2.Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry: National. US EPAPortland cement manufacturing is an energy intensive process in which cement is made by grinding and heating a mixture of raw materials such as limestone,clay,sand,and iron ore in a rotary kiln.The kiln is a large furnace that is fueled by coal,oil,gas,coke and or various waste materials.
