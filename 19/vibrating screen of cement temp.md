Note,however,that revibration of concrete before the final set,under controlled conditions,can improve concrete strength markedly and reduce surface voids (bugholes).This technique is too difficult to control for general use on field cast vertical elements,but it is very effective in finishing slabs with powered vibrating equipment.Cement Standards and Concrete Standards astmASTM's cement and concrete standards are instrumental in the evaluation and testing of concrete,cement,and aggregates.Concrete can have different properties depending upon the mixture that is used in creating it,which contains cement,chemical admixtures,and aggregates.

## Vibrating screen
The linear vibrating screen with advantages of dehydration,sculping,desliming and effective screening is used widely for screening products.During the working process,the main parts of vibrating screen endure long time high frequency alternating loads,often resulting in crack on lateral board and beams.High frequency vibrating screens WikipediaLimitations of the high frequency vibrating screen are that the fine screens are very fragile and are susceptible to becoming blocked very easily.Over time the separation efficiency will drop and the screen will need to be replaced.An alternative to the high frequency vibrating screens is the rotary sifter.
